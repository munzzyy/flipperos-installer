//! The installer engine: partition, format, receive snapshots, install kernels.
//!
//! Every destructive step goes through `exec`, which honours
//! [`Config::dry_run`]: in dry-run mode commands are logged but not executed, so
//! the whole flow can be exercised safely on a development host.
//!
//! The high-level flow mirrors what the user selected in either frontend:
//!   1. `blkdiscard` the whole target device.
//!   2. Write a fresh GPT reserving the RK3576 bootloader area.
//!   3. Write the bootloader. On UFS it goes only to the spare boot LU, and the
//!      boot ROM is switched over to it once the image verifies; everywhere else
//!      it goes to the reserved boot area at the start of the loader partition.
//!      On UFS the Falcon boot menu then goes to that reserved area instead, the
//!      bootloader having no need of it, and the Falcon recovery system goes to
//!      the logical unit provisioned for it.
//!   4. `mkfs.btrfs` on the root partition and create the subvolume skeleton.
//!   5. If the build ships a `/home` seed, `btrfs receive` it to a transient
//!      base and snapshot a writable `@home` from it so /home starts populated.
//!   6. For each selected profile: `btrfs receive` its snapshot stream, then
//!      chroot into it and run `kernel-install` for every installed kernel.
